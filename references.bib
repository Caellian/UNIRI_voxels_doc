  abstract   = {Traditionally, 3D models, even so called solid ones, can only
                represent the object's surface information, and the interior is
                regarded as homogeneous. In most applications, it is necessary
                to represent the interior structures and attributes of an
                object, such as materials, density and color, etc. Surface
                model is incapable of bearing this task. In this case, voxel
                model is a good choice. Voxelization is the process of
                converting a geometrically represented 3D object into a three
                dimensional volume of dataset. In this paper, an algorithm is
                proposed to voxelize the polygonal meshes ported from current
                CAD modeling packages into volume datasets based on the easily
                indexing property of Octree structure. The minimal distance to
                the feature voxel (or voxels) is taken as criterion to
                distribute different material compositions to get a new kind of
                material called FGM (functionally graded material), which is
                suitable for the interface of RPM (Rapid Prototyping
                Manufacturing).},

  abstract  = {Automated CAD model simplification plays an important role in
               effectively utilizing physics-based simulation during the
               product realization process. Currently a rich body of literature
               exists that describe many successful techniques for
               fully-automatic or semi-automatic simplification of CAD models
               for a wide variety of applications. The purpose of this paper is
               to compile a list of the techniques that are relevant for
               physics-based simulations problems and to characterize them
               based on their attributes. We have classified them into the
               following four categories: techniques based on surface entity
               based operators, volume entity based operators, explicit feature
               based operators, and dimension reduction operators. This paper
               also presents the necessary background information in the CAD
               model representation to assist the new readers. We conclude the
               paper by outlining open research directions in this field.},

  author    = {Jjumba, Anthony and Dragi{\'c}evi{\'c}, Suzana},
  abstract  = {Many geographic processes evolve in a three dimensional space
               and time continuum. However, when they are represented with the
               aid of geographic information systems (GIS) or geosimulation
               models they are modelled in a framework of two-dimensional space
               with an added temporal component. The objective of this study is
               to propose the design and implementation of voxel-based automata
               as a methodological approach for representing spatial processes
               evolving in the four-dimensional (4D) space--time domain.
               Similar to geographic automata models which are developed to
               capture and forecast geospatial processes that change in a
               two-dimensional spatial framework using cells (raster geospatial
               data), voxel automata rely on the automata theory and use
               three-dimensional volumetric units (voxels). Transition rules
               have been developed to represent various spatial processes which
               range from the movement of an object in 3D to the diffusion of
               airborne particles and landslide simulation. In addition, the
               proposed 4D models demonstrate that complex processes can be
               readily reproduced from simple transition functions without
               complex methodological approaches. The voxel-based automata
               approach provides a unique basis to model geospatial processes
               in 4D for the purpose of improving representation, analysis and
               understanding their spatiotemporal dynamics. This study
               contributes to the advancement of the concepts and framework of
               4D GIS.},

  author       = {Park, Jeong Joon and Florence, Peter and Straub, Julian and

  abstract     = {Computer graphics, 3D computer vision and robotics
                  communities have produced multiple approaches to representing
                  3D geometry for rendering and reconstruction. These provide
                  trade-offs across fidelity, efficiency and compression
                  capabilities. In this work, we introduce DeepSDF, a learned
                  continuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) representation of a
                  class of shapes that enables high quality shape
                  representation, interpolation and completion from partial and
                  noisy 3D input data. DeepSDF, like its classical counterpart,
                  represents a shape's surface by a continuous volumetric
                  field: the magnitude of a point in the field represents the
                  distance to the surface boundary and the sign indicates
                  whether the region is inside (-) or outside (+) of the shape,
                  hence our representation implicitly encodes a shape's
                  boundary as the zero-level-set of the learned function while
                  explicitly representing the classification of space as being
                  part of the shapes interior or not. While classical SDF's
                  both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically
                  represent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can
                  represent an entire class of shapes. Furthermore, we show
                  state-of-the-art performance for learned 3D shape
                  representation and completion while reducing the model size
                  by an order of magnitude compared with previous work.},
